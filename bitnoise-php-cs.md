1. Overview
-----------

- Files MUST use only `<?php` tags.

- Files MUST use only UTF-8 without BOM for PHP code.

- Files SHOULD *either* declare symbols (classes, functions, constants, etc.)
  *or* cause side-effects (e.g. generate output, change .ini settings, etc.)
  but SHOULD NOT do both.

- Class names MUST be declared in `StudlyCaps`.

- Class constants MUST be declared in all upper case with underscore separators.

- Method names MUST be declared in `camelCase`.

- The closing `?>` tag MUST be omitted from files containing only PHP.

- Code MUST use 4 spaces for indenting, not tabs.

- There MUST NOT be a hard limit on line length; the soft limit MUST be 120
  characters; lines SHOULD be 80 characters or less.

- Opening braces for classes MUST go on the next line, and closing braces MUST
  go on the next line after the body.

- Opening braces for methods MUST go on the next line, and closing braces MUST
  go on the next line after the body.

- Control structure keywords MUST have one space after them; method and
  function calls MUST NOT.

- Opening braces for control structures MUST go on the same line, and closing
  braces MUST go on the next line after the body.

2. Structure
------------

- Add a single space after each comma delimiter.

- Add a single space around operators (==, &&, ...).

- Add a blank line before return statements, unless the return is alone inside a statement-group (like an if statement).

- Define one class per file - this does not apply to private helper classes that are not intended to be
  instantiated from the outside.

- Declare class properties before methods.

- Declare public methods first, then protected ones and finally private ones.

3. Naming Conventions
---------------------

- Use camelCase, not underscores, for variable, function and method names, arguments.

- Use underscores for option, parameter names.

- Use namespaces for all classes.

- Suffix interfaces with Interface.

- Use alphanumeric characters and underscores for file names.

4. Documentation
----------------
- Add PHPDoc blocks for all classes, methods, and functions.

- Omit the @return tag if the method does not return anything.

5. Namespace and Use Declarations
---------------------------------

When present, there MUST be one blank line after the `namespace` declaration.

When present, all `use` declarations MUST go after the `namespace`
declaration.

There MUST be one `use` keyword per declaration.

There MUST be one blank line after the `use` block.

For example:

```php
<?php
namespace Vendor\Package;

use FooClass;
use BarClass as Bar;
use OtherVendor\OtherPackage\BazClass;

// ... additional PHP code ...

```


6. Classes, Properties, and Methods
-----------------------------------

### 6.1. Extends and Implements

The `extends` and `implements` keywords MUST be declared on the same line as
the class name.

The opening brace for the class go MUST go on its own line; the closing brace
for the class MUST go on the next line after the body.

```php
<?php
namespace Vendor\Package;

use FooClass;
use BarClass as Bar;
use OtherVendor\OtherPackage\BazClass;

class ClassName extends ParentClass implements \ArrayAccess, \Countable
{
    // constants, properties, methods
}
```

Lists of `implements` MAY be split across multiple lines, where each
subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list
MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one interface per line.

```php
<?php
namespace Vendor\Package;

use FooClass;
use BarClass as Bar;
use OtherVendor\OtherPackage\BazClass;

class ClassName extends ParentClass implements
    \ArrayAccess,
    \Countable,
    \Serializable
{
    // constants, properties, methods
}
```

### 6.2. Properties

Visibility MUST be declared on all properties.

The `var` keyword MUST NOT be used to declare a property.

There MUST NOT be more than one property declared per statement.

Property names SHOULD NOT be prefixed with a single underscore to indicate
protected or private visibility.

A property declaration looks like the following.

```php
<?php
namespace Vendor\Package;

class ClassName
{
    public $foo = null;
}
```

### 6.3. Methods

Visibility MUST be declared on all methods.

Method names SHOULD NOT be prefixed with a single underscore to indicate
protected or private visibility.

Method names MUST NOT be declared with a space after the method name. The
opening brace MUST go on its own line, and the closing brace MUST go on the
next line following the body. There MUST NOT be a space after the opening
parenthesis, and there MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis.

A method declaration looks like the following. Note the placement of
parentheses, commas, spaces, and braces:

```php
<?php
namespace Vendor\Package;

class ClassName
{
    public function fooBarBaz($arg1, &$arg2, $arg3 = [])
    {
        // method body
    }
}
```

### 6.4. Method Arguments

In the argument list, there MUST NOT be a space before each comma, and there
MUST be one space after each comma.

Method arguments with default values MUST go at the end of the argument
list.

```php
<?php
namespace Vendor\Package;

class ClassName
{
    public function foo($arg1, &$arg2, $arg3 = [])
    {
        // method body
    }
}
```

Argument lists MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line
is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list MUST be on the
next line, and there MUST be only one argument per line.

When the argument list is split across multiple lines, the closing parenthesis
and opening brace MUST be placed together on their own line with one space
between them.

```php
<?php
namespace Vendor\Package;

class ClassName
{
    public function aVeryLongMethodName(
        ClassTypeHint $arg1,
        &$arg2,
        array $arg3 = []
    ) {
        // method body
    }
}
```

### 6.5. `abstract`, `final`, and `static`

When present, the `abstract` and `final` declarations MUST precede the
visibility declaration.

When present, the `static` declaration MUST come after the visibility
declaration.

```php
<?php
namespace Vendor\Package;

abstract class ClassName
{
    protected static $foo;

    abstract protected function zim();

    final public static function bar()
    {
        // method body
    }
}
```

### 6.6. Method and Function Calls

When making a method or function call, there MUST NOT be a space between the
method or function name and the opening parenthesis, there MUST NOT be a space
after the opening parenthesis, and there MUST NOT be a space before the
closing parenthesis. In the argument list, there MUST NOT be a space before
each comma, and there MUST be one space after each comma.

```php
<?php
bar();
$foo->bar($arg1);
Foo::bar($arg2, $arg3);
```

Argument lists MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line
is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list MUST be on the
next line, and there MUST be only one argument per line.

```php
<?php
$foo->bar(
    $longArgument,
    $longerArgument,
    $muchLongerArgument
);
```


7. Control Structures
---------------------

The general style rules for control structures are as follows:

- There MUST be one space after the control structure keyword
- There MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis
- There MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis
- There MUST be one space between the closing parenthesis and the opening
  brace
- The structure body MUST be indented once
- The closing brace MUST be on the next line after the body

The body of each structure MUST be enclosed by braces. This standardizes how
the structures look, and reduces the likelihood of introducing errors as new
lines get added to the body.


### 7.1. `if`, `elseif`, `else`

An `if` structure looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses,
spaces, and braces; and that `else` and `elseif` are on the same line as the
closing brace from the earlier body.

```php
<?php
if ($expr1) {
    // if body
} elseif ($expr2) {
    // elseif body
} else {
    // else body;
}
```

The keyword `elseif` SHOULD be used instead of `else if` so that all control
keywords look like single words.


### 7.2. `switch`, `case`

A `switch` structure looks like the following. Note the placement of
parentheses, spaces, and braces. The `case` statement MUST be indented once
from `switch`, and the `break` keyword (or other terminating keyword) MUST be
indented at the same level as the `case` body. There MUST be a comment such as
`// no break` when fall-through is intentional in a non-empty `case` body.

```php
<?php
switch ($expr) {
    case 0:
        echo 'First case, with a break';
        break;
    case 1:
        echo 'Second case, which falls through';
        // no break
    case 2:
    case 3:
    case 4:
        echo 'Third case, return instead of break';
        return;
    default:
        echo 'Default case';
        break;
}
```


### 7.3. `while`, `do while`

A `while` statement looks like the following. Note the placement of
parentheses, spaces, and braces.

```php
<?php
while ($expr) {
    // structure body
}
```

Similarly, a `do while` statement looks like the following. Note the placement
of parentheses, spaces, and braces.

```php
<?php
do {
    // structure body;
} while ($expr);
```

### 7.4. `for`

A `for` statement looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses,
spaces, and braces.

```php
<?php
for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
    // for body
}
```

### 7.5. `foreach`

A `foreach` statement looks like the following. Note the placement of
parentheses, spaces, and braces.

```php
<?php
foreach ($iterable as $key => $value) {
    // foreach body
}
```

### 7.6. `try`, `catch`

A `try catch` block looks like the following. Note the placement of
parentheses, spaces, and braces.

```php
<?php
try {
    // try body
} catch (FirstExceptionType $e) {
    // catch body
} catch (OtherExceptionType $e) {
    // catch body
}
```
