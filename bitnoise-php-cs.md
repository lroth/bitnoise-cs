1. Overview
-----------

- Files MUST use only `<?php` tags.

- Files MUST use only UTF-8 without BOM for PHP code.

- Files SHOULD *either* declare symbols (classes, functions, constants, etc.)
  *or* cause side-effects (e.g. generate output, change .ini settings, etc.)
  but SHOULD NOT do both.

- Namespaces and classes MUST follow [PSR-0][].

- Class names MUST be declared in `StudlyCaps`.

- Class constants MUST be declared in all upper case with underscore separators.

- Method names MUST be declared in `camelCase`.

- The closing `?>` tag MUST be omitted from files containing only PHP.

- Code MUST use 4 spaces for indenting, not tabs.

- There MUST NOT be a hard limit on line length; the soft limit MUST be 120
  characters; lines SHOULD be 80 characters or less.

- There MUST be one blank line after the `namespace` declaration, and there
  MUST be one blank line after the block of `use` declarations.

- Opening braces for classes MUST go on the next line, and closing braces MUST
  go on the next line after the body.

- Opening braces for methods MUST go on the next line, and closing braces MUST
  go on the next line after the body.

- Visibility MUST be declared on all properties and methods; `abstract` and
  `final` MUST be declared before the visibility; `static` MUST be declared
  after the visibility.

- Control structure keywords MUST have one space after them; method and
  function calls MUST NOT.

- Opening braces for control structures MUST go on the same line, and closing
  braces MUST go on the next line after the body.

2. Namespace and Class Names
----------------------------

Namespaces and classes MUST follow [PSR-0][].

This means each class is in a file by itself, and is in a namespace of at
least one level: a top-level vendor name.

Class names MUST be declared in `StudlyCaps`.

Code written for PHP 5.3 and after MUST use formal namespaces.

For example:

```php
<?php
// PHP 5.3 and later:
namespace Vendor\Model;

class Foo
{
}

```

3. Keywords and True/False/Null
-------------------------------

The PHP constants true, false, and null MUST be in lower case.

3. Namespace and Use Declarations
---------------------------------

When present, there MUST be one blank line after the `namespace` declaration.

When present, all `use` declarations MUST go after the `namespace`
declaration.

There MUST be one `use` keyword per declaration.

There MUST be one blank line after the `use` block.

For example:

```php
<?php
namespace Vendor\Package;

use FooClass;
use BarClass as Bar;
use OtherVendor\OtherPackage\BazClass;

// ... additional PHP code ...

```
